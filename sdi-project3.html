<article>
<p>For project 3 I decided to build upon the previous story based on an App that that accepts paying and non paying users and gives options depending on the type of user.</p>
<p>It also builds upon the idea that there will be other functions or parts of the code that would have already verified different things like; device type, bad phone and other information input by the user as well.</p>
<p>I would like to see how these parts of coding within real Apps look like and hope to see it soon and finally work on them.</p>
